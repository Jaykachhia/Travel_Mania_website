# Travel Mania React Website

This repository contains the source code for a React website project. The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This README file provides information on how to set up and run the project, as well as guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-website.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd react-website
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the website in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the website.

### Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized build of the website in the `build` directory.
